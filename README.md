# [able.js](https://github.com/UniBreakfast/able.js)

It's a microframework to handle easily switchable children of DOM elements and just as easily re-renderable lists of children (by template) simply by HTML with certain classes, data-attributes and corresponding object-properties of the app-object.

## Descritption
You can use certain classes that are being handled by the framework in the background
- **`switchable`** can show one of children with class `mode`
- **`renderable`** can render subtree or use `template` tag while filling in corresponding data
- **`togglable`** can be easily toggled between `active` and not.
